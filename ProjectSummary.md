# Introduction #

Hi, welcome to DICOMLIB.  This is a set of C++ libraries that have been used for many years at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and other institutions.  If you don't know what DICOM is, you're probably in the wrong place.  If you have to work with DICOM images, this could well be helpful to you.


# Details #

Currently I'm providing the source code to **dicomlib** and associated utilities.  I've also written **pydicomlib**, a rather neat python dicom implementation, which I'll try to get up here too when I get a moment.
